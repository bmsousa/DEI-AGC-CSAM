Simple Buffer Overflow Examples
===


A buffer overflow is a common software coding mistake that an attacker could exploit to gain access to your system.
To effectively mitigate buffer overflow vulnerabilities, it is important to understand what buffer overflows are, what dangers they pose to your applications, and what techniques attackers use to successfully exploit these vulnerabilities.

## Key Concepts of Buffer Overflow

* This error occurs when there is more data in a buffer than it can handle, causing data to overflow into adjacent storage.
* This vulnerability can cause a system crash or, worse, create an entry point for an attack.
